# Facial Recognition using OpenCV

## Overview

This my first project in Computer Vision. What started as a simple interest in machine learning, led me to explore many fascinating topics such as language processing, image processing etc.
Once I decided to study a little about image processing, I learned more about deep learning models, computer vision and the different applications of simple programs such as facial recognition or object recognition.
This is my attempt at a simple facial recognition program, created using openCV.

## Project Structure

This is the format of the files contained within this repository.
* Facial Recognition -
  * face-recognition-mytake.py
  * haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
  * haarcascade_eye.xml
  * tempCodeRunnerFile.py

## Requirements
 
 * OpenCV (cv2)
 * Python 3.6 or later versions

## Installation

This is a relatively simple project to create and run on your system. Follow the steps given below:

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-recognition-basic.git
   cd facial-recognition-basic
2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
3. Run the Program
   ```bash
   python face-recognition-mytake.py

## Using the Project

After running the file, you should be able to see yourself in your webcam, with pink and purple rectangles on your face, detecting your face and eyes. 
**Press the 'q' key to exit the webcam**.
