# Facial Recognition using OpenCV

## Overview

This my first project in Computer Vision. What started as a simple interest in machine learning, led me to explore many fascinating topics such as language processing, image processing etc.
Once I decided to study a little about image processing, I learned more about deep learning models, computer vision and the different applications of simple programs such as facial recognition or object recognition.
This is my attempt at a simple facial recognition program, created using openCV.
